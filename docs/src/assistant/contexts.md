# Introducing Contexts

### Saving and Loading Contexts

After you submit your first message, a name for your context is generated by the language model, and the context is automatically saved to your file system in `~/.config/zed/contexts`. You can access and load previous contexts by clicking on the hamburger button in the top-left corner of the assistant panel.
